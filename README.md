There are about 340 different breeds of dogs in the world, and this diversity of breeds creates large variability between dogs. 

The variability takes place in different characteristics of the animal, one of them is the trainability of the dog, i.e., how easy it will be for a pet owner to raise the pet.

In this work we will delve into the question: is There a causal effect of a dog’s ease of training on its popularity. 

To answer this question, we will first have to understand the confounders that affect both ease of training and popularity. Then, we will apply causal inference methods, and construct causal model that will yield evaluated findings regard this question.

It contains information about 172 different dog breeds.
