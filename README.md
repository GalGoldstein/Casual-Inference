**Introduction**

Nowadays the dog is the most popular pet. There are about 340 different breeds of dogs in the world, and this diversity of breeds creates large variability between dogs. The variability takes place in different characteristics of the animal, one of them is the trainability of the dog, i.e., how easy it will be for a pet owner to raise the pet. The trainability goes hand in hand with the intelligence of the pet, which differs between the breeds. 

There can be many reasons for the gap in trainability between one breed to another. Some of them are known to us and some are not. 

There are also many reasons why a dog breed is popular among pet owners. for example, the Labrador dog breed is the most popular in America. It might be because Labradors are friendly, helpful, playful, and highly trainable. But there can be also esoteric hidden reasons for dog popularity, for example, after the release of the movie ‘Men in Black’, the popularity of the pug breed skyrocketed.

In this work we will delve into the question: is There a causal effect of a dog’s ease of training on its popularity. 

To answer this question, we will first have to understand the confounders that affect both ease of training and popularity. Then, we will apply causal inference methods, and construct causal model that will yield evaluated findings regard this question.
